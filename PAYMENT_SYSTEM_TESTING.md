# Payment System Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive testing guide for the Student Management Information System (SMIS) payment functionality.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **API Query Structure Issues**
- ✅ Fixed `getPendingPayments()` function to properly query separate tables
- ✅ Removed incorrect joins with `student_payments` in main query
- ✅ Added proper error handling for each API call
- ✅ Fixed currency formatting issues

### 2. **Database Relationship Problems**
- ✅ Removed references to non-existent `payment_plans` and `payment_transactions` tables
- ✅ Fixed foreign key relationships in payment creation
- ✅ Added proper validation for required fields

### 3. **UI/UX Improvements**
- ✅ Added payment analytics dashboard
- ✅ Improved error handling and loading states
- ✅ Added processing indicators for payment submissions
- ✅ Enhanced currency formatting with proper LKR display

### 4. **Business Logic Corrections**
- ✅ Fixed pending payment calculation logic
- ✅ Proper handling of registration fee completion (Rs. 50,000)
- ✅ Accurate program fee tracking from fee_structure table
- ✅ Improved payment type selection and validation

## Test Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Pending Payments Display
**Expected Behavior:**
- Students with incomplete registration fees (< Rs. 50,000) should show as "Registration Incomplete"
- Students with pending program fees should show appropriate pending amounts
- Analytics should display correct revenue totals

**Test Data:**
- John Doe: Rs. 25,000 registration paid, Rs. 650,000 program fee pending
- Test: Rs. 50,000+ registration paid, Rs. 650,000 program fee paid

### Test Case 2: Payment Processing
**Steps:**
1. Click "Process Payment" button
2. Select student from dropdown
3. Choose payment type (Registration Fee/Program Fee)
4. Enter amount
5. Select payment method
6. Submit payment

**Expected Results:**
- Payment should be recorded in `student_payments` table
- Pending amounts should update automatically
- Success message should display
- Receipt number should be generated

### Test Case 3: Payment Analytics
**Verification:**
- Total Revenue should sum all completed payments
- Registration Revenue should sum only registration fee payments
- Program Revenue should sum only program fee payments
- Transaction count should be accurate

### Test Case 4: Data Integrity
**Checks:**
- No negative pending amounts
- Payments properly linked to enrollments
- Currency formatting consistent throughout
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs

## API Testing

### 1. Test Pending Payments API
```javascript
// Test the API directly in browser console
import { getPendingPayments } from './src/lib/api/payments.js';
getPendingPayments().then(data => console.log('Pending Payments:', data));
```

### 2. Test Payment Creation API
```javascript
// Test payment creation
import { createPaymentTransaction } from './src/lib/api/payments.js';
const testPayment = {
  enrollment_id: 'your-enrollment-id',
  payment_type: 'Registration Fee',
  amount: 25000,
  payment_method: 'Cash',
  description: 'Test payment'
};
createPaymentTransaction(testPayment).then(result => console.log('Payment Created:', result));
```

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Payment Data
```sql
SELECT 
  e.student_name,
  p.name as program,
  sp.payment_type,
  sp.amount,
  sp.payment_status,
  sp.created_at
FROM student_payments sp
JOIN enrollments e ON sp.enrollment_id = e.id
JOIN programs p ON e.program_id = p.id
ORDER BY sp.created_at DESC;
```

### Verify Pending Calculations
```sql
SELECT 
  e.student_name,
  f.fee_type,
  f.amount as required,
  COALESCE(SUM(sp.amount), 0) as paid,
  f.amount - COALESCE(SUM(sp.amount), 0) as pending
FROM enrollments e
JOIN programs p ON e.program_id = p.id
JOIN fee_structure f ON p.id = f.program_id
LEFT JOIN student_payments sp ON e.id = sp.enrollment_id 
  AND sp.payment_type = f.fee_type 
  AND sp.payment_status = 'Completed'
GROUP BY e.id, e.student_name, f.fee_type, f.amount
ORDER BY e.student_name, f.fee_type;
```

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Test with 100+ enrollments
- Verify page load times under 3 seconds
- Check memory usage during large data loads

### Error Handling
- Test with invalid enrollment IDs
- Test with negative payment amounts
- Verify proper error messages display

## Security Testing

### Input Validation
- Test SQL injection prevention
- Verify amount validation (no negative values)
- Check required field validation

### Authorization
- Verify proper user context in payment creation
- Check that payments are attributed to correct user

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Functional Requirements
- [x] Pending payments calculation works correctly
- [x] Payment processing completes successfully
- [x] Analytics display accurate data
- [x] Currency formatting is consistent
- [x] Error handling is robust

### ✅ Non-Functional Requirements
- [x] Page loads within 3 seconds
- [x] No console errors during normal operation
- [x] Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- [x] Data persistence across page refreshes

## Known Limitations

1. **Real-time Updates**: Page requires manual refresh to see payments from other users
2. **Batch Operations**: No bulk payment processing capability
3. **Payment Plans**: Installment payment plans not yet implemented
4. **Reporting**: Advanced payment reports not included in current version
